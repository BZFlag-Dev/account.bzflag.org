# BZFlag Account Manager

This site will be used for the management of BZFlag accounts, organizations, groups, and server keys. It is part of
multiphase plan to improve or replace the web services for BZFlag, as documented in the
[design document](https://gist.github.com/blast007/ff89e7186262ceef9dacd26a224eb5de#file-bzflag_web_2021_2022-md).

This will make use of a phpBB extensions, at least at first. The extension, which is in development already at
[SnailPaste/phpbb-external-integration](https://github.com/SnailPaste/phpbb-external-integration), will provide an API
for managing user accounts in phpBB. This will allow the account manager site to create and manage user accounts in the
BZFlag forums.
